# World Countries Explorer

This project is a web application that lists all countries in the world using data from the **REST Countries API**.

The application allows users to search for countries and view detailed information such as population, capital, region, subregion, and geographic coordinates. When a country is selected, a modal is displayed with additional details and an interactive map showing the country’s location.

The map functionality is implemented using **Leaflet**, a JavaScript library for interactive maps, which uses the latitude and longitude provided by the API.

This project was built with **React** and focuses on practicing API consumption, component-based architecture, and UI organization.
